\section{Conclusion}
The objective of this research was to analyse the relation between loop features and optimal chunk size, and also try to improve the predictions of the Multinomial Classification by usig a regresion algorithm. The hypothesis was that using a regression would reduce the execution time of hpx for-loops since it allows to interpolate between chunk size candidates. However, it was seen that using regression is not significantly better. In fact making improvements to the Multinomial Classification has proven to be as succesfull as using other algorithms. One can wonder why didn't the regression do better. That is simply because for all experiments, close chunk sizes have very close execution times and therefore there is no significant difference between interpolating between candidates or simply choosing candidates from a finite set. According to this research I would say that the next work should focus on the Multinomial Logistic Regression (classification) algorithm. It would still be interesting to keep studying regressions as one would expect them to perform better for very big algorithms where the execution times vary much more with respect to chunk size.
