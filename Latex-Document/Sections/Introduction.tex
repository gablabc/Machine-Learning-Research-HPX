\section*{Project Overview}
 In today's day and age, we are constantly trying to optimize our algorithms to improve performance and minimize execution time. One of the ways we can achieve those goals is by using loop-level parallelism. If an algorithm is made of independent iterations, such a technique can be used. Using HPX's $for\_each()$ algorithm, the different iterations are assigned to threads and then to different CPU's. One of the key parameters of parallelization is chunk size which, in that case, represents how much work is assigned to a single thread.
The goal of this project is to be able to predict the optimal chunk size for a given task. \\

One method that has proven to be successful to predict such parameters is machine learning. In machine learning, you train a model based on data to get predictions on new situations. The first section will focus on the notation used during the document.
